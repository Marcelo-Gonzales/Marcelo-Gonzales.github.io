  <h1>About</h1>
  <time datetime=0001-01-01T00:00:00Z class="post-date">Mon, Jan 1, 0001</time>
  <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Marcelo. I currently work as a Design Engineer at a small company that does a lot of electronics. For privacy reasons, I&rsquo;m not gonna elaborate too much. I studied Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines</a> in Golden, CO. The reason I decided to double major was because I figured that having the knowledge of computers will be imperative in any industry. I see many universities requiring their STEM non-CS students be proficient in programming. As time goes on, this will become more of standard and every STEM major graduate will most likely know at least one programming language. But I digress, I created this blog in order to improve myself&ndash;not only as a professional but also as a human being. The posts that will be part of this blog will include different weekend projects that I&rsquo;m working on as well as my musings about life. And maybe some book reviews as well.</p>
<p>Another reason I started this blog was to organize myself a bit better (not that I&rsquo;m disorganized or anything&hellip;) and simply document some of the things that I work on. I also need to improve on my writing skills. A lot of people say that engineers are not the best writers, so I will try my best in getting rid of that stereotype.</p>
